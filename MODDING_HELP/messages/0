Heya, and welcome to <#953393160464269402>! This is your new home to ask for help with modding or troubleshooting the game, vanilla or not.
**Please make sure you've read the channel description and this post before making your own.**

If you're looking to get set up with modding in the first place, check out <#928422006985203822> and the pins for any other channels that may be relevant.

Before making a post, read through the following points:

# **If Everest or Celeste itself is crashing, please check if it is [a known/common crash](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Common-Crashes>) first.**
- **Try updating Everest and your mods.** It's possible that an update may have already fixed your issue.
- **Make sure to include necessary logs.**
  - For Everest crashes, the "Oooops!" crash screen will tell you what file to upload, along with a button to open the folder it's in. If your issue is not a crash, you can find `log.txt` or `error_log.txt` in the folder Celeste is installed to.
  - For Olympus issues, its logs location is described in the </olympuslogs:1172673423042949141> command.
- **Describe your problem *as accurately as you can***, so that we can focus on solving it immediately instead of having to figure out what issue you're having in the first place.
- **Make sure to add any relevant tags**, such as :warning: Crash
- Following these steps makes the lives of the people who are trying to help you much easier. Please respect their time.
