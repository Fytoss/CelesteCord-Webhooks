# Welcome to <#696801669517672658>!
**This is a place for artists to discuss asset creation for Celeste mods, and to showcase what they've made.**
**If you're interested in adding custom Audio or Sound Effects, check out <#1253617607664336917> as well.**

Mappers, if you want to use an asset in your map, **ask for permission first** or check if it is on the Community Asset Drive (see below).  
Artists, if your work is freely usable by anyone, please tag it as such, or upload it to the Community Asset Drive (see below).

General information on tilesets, portraits, decals, and other resources for asset creation can be found under the Graphics section of the [Everest Wiki](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki>). Feel free to update it if necessary - any and all contributions are greatly appreciated!

If you need to browse vanilla textures, check out <@354341658352943115>'s [Graphics Dump Browser](<https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/graphics-dump-browser>) for version 1.4.0.0. From there, you can download individual textures or the entire dump in `.png` format.

If you need custom assets, head over to the [Community Asset Drive](<https://maddie480.ovh/celeste/asset-drive>). It is packed full of tilesets, stylegrounds, decals, and more for all modders to use. If you want to contribute yourself, ping the <@&1217533882891763792>.

You may also find various Asset Packs in the [Assets](<https://gamebanana.com/mods/cats/15655>) category on GameBanana. **Please familiarize yourself with their terms before using them** (usually in the description).

If you're just getting started (or just want to up your game), you can also have a look at Pedro's (the spriter for Celeste) amazing [Pixel Art Tutorials](<https://lospec.com/pixel-art-tutorials/author/pedro-medeiros>).

If you're interested in starting a skin mod, you can find some useful **templates** and other resources at the [Skinmods](<https://github.com/EverestAPI/Resources/wiki/Skinmods>) wiki page.
